I'm a third year PhD stundent in  [LACODAM](https://team.inria.fr/lacodam/fr/) team at IRISA/INRIA Rennes laboratory. My supervisors are Prof. [Elisa FROMONT] (http://people.irisa.fr/Elisa.Fromont/) and [Romaric Gaudel] (https://sites.google.com/site/romaricgaudel/). As I am doing a industrial PhD, I work also as a Research Scientist in the Digital Innovation Departement of Louis Vuitton in Paris. My current research interest are recommendation systems and bandits algorithms.
